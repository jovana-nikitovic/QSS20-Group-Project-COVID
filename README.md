# QSS20-Group-Project-COVID
repo for our Final Project on the COVID-19 Twitter dataset

# Project Title: Our Title!!!!???? hahah

## Description
This project focuses on a public Twitter dataset from the time of the pandemic, with the dataset’s observations representing users’ tweets pertaining to the topics regarding COVID-19. Our primary research question investigates how a user’s sentiment score varies across several factors such as political affiliation, economic conditions, pandemic-related keywords, and other social and demographic markers.

Political affiliation was central to our study, given the significant role that partisan perspectives played in shaping public attitudes toward health measures, economic policies, and government interventions during the pandemic. Similarly, economic themes in tweets were explored to gauge public sentiment about financial stability and policy responses. Pandemic-related keywords further enabled a deeper analysis of how specific topics, such as vaccination, contact tracing, or the country’s ruler (e.g. the Biden administration in the United States during the peak time period of the virus) influenced sentiment trends.

In addition to these primary factors, we extended our analysis to include secondary components that might also affect sentiment. These included social markers such as the user’s verification status and the number of friends in their network. Furthermore, we also considered temporal trends based on tweet timestamps and geographical influences derived from the user's reported location of posting. The analysis acknowledged both the international nature of the dataset and the US-specific users. However, given that the majority of postings (observations in the dataset) originated in the United States, our project focused on those users. Altogether, the above mentioned variables provide a comprehensive view of the sentiment dynamics across a diverse population.

## Repo Structure
### [Code](https://github.com/jovana-nikitovic/QSS20-Group-Project-COVID/blob/main/code):
`code/` directory: Contains all the scripts used in this project. Clicking on each of the notebook names will lead you to them:
#### [00_mia.ipynb](https://github.com/jovana-nikitovic/QSS20-Group-Project-COVID/blob/main/code/00_mia.ipynb)
##### Takes in:
- The "econ_sample.pkl" pickle file
- This is the Public Tweet dataset of Twitter users' posts during the time of the COVID-19
- Furthermore, it is subsetted down to keywords pertaining to the economy, government, and institutional regulations that Professor Chang kindly shared with us
##### What it does:
- The notebook creates several bar graph, box plot, and KDE plot visualizations of sentiment score by political affiliation for statistically significant keywords.
- It calculates the mean average sentiment score by political affiliation for over 20 keywords and tests whether they are well-represented in the dataset.
- It utilizes multiple methods of statistical significance testing such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene’s test for equal variances, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Tukey Honest Significant Difference Test to evaluate the robustness of certain keywords (using 5% or 10% significance levels).

##### Outputs:
-Visualizations described in the Outputs section of this repo and statistical significance tests. 

#### [02_jovana.ipynb](https://github.com/jovana-nikitovic/QSS20-Group-Project-COVID/blob/main/code/02_jovana.ipynb)
##### Takes in:
- The "econ_sample.pkl" pickle file
- This is the Public Tweet dataset of Twitter users' posts during the time of the COVID-19
- Furthermore, it is subsetted down to keywords pertaining to the economy, government, and institutional regulations that Professor Chang kindly shared with us
##### What it does:
- The notebook creates Summary Graphics Visualizations of geographic variations in setiment score: International (Country-based) and US-specific (further broken down by the Political Affiliation Category)
- It performs three iterations of Linear Regression where sentiment score is being predicted based on social markers of Twitter users displayed publicly
- It performs two Multinomial Logistic Regressions, where the target variable (political affiliation) differs in terms of classes: four ("Red", "Blue", "Flip", "Unknown") vs three (without the "Unknown", which turned out to be the majority class)
##### Outputs:
- Visualizations described in the Outputs section of this repo, as well as the evaluations of the models

Professor Chang shared these datasets with us. Thank you so much!
We focused mainly on the dataset named "econ_sample.pkl", as well as the US-electoral data of presidential results in 2020 from the following website: https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president
