# QSS20-Group-Project-COVID
repo for our Final Project on the COVID-19 dataset

# Project Title: Our Title

## Description
We’d like to investigate the relationship between an increase in COVID-19 cases and an increase in Tweets professing a negative sentiment towards the government. We want to further examine this potential relationship between “red” and “blue” states. Our Null Hypothesis is that, with the increase in COVID-19 reported cases, the number of tweets professing a negative perspective towards the government would increase at a higher rate in “red” states than it would in “blue” states.
